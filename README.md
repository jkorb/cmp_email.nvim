# cmp_email.nvim

Custom completion source for `nvim-cmp` (https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp), which uses `mu cfind` (https://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu/) to complete email
addresses in address fields of email. Written for personal use as a learning
experience. I've learned how easy it is to write custom completion sources from

you, enjoy. Otherwise, ignore.
